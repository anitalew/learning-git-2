	<h1>Space oddity</h1>
	<h3>Author: David Bowie</h3>
	<p>Ground control to major Tom<br>Ground control to major Tom<br>Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.</p>
	<p>Ground control to major Tom<br>Commencing countdown, engines on<br>Check ignition and may Gods love be with you...</p>
	<p>(Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,<br>Four, three, two, one, liftoff...)</p>
	<p>This is ground control to major Tom<br>You've really made the grade!<br>And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear.<br>Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare</p>
	<p>This is major Tom to ground control;<br>I'm stepping through the door<br>And I'm floating in a most peculiar way<br>And the stars look very different today.</p>
	<p>For here<br>Am I sitting in my tin can,<br>Far above the World<br>Planet Earth is blue,<br>And there's nothing I can do</p>
	<p>Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles<br>I'm feeling very still,<br>And I think my spaceship knows which way to go<br>Tell my wife I love her very much<br>She knows</p>
	<p>Ground control to major Tom<br>Your circuits dead, there's something wrong<br>Can you hear me, major Tom?<br>Can you hear me, major Tom?<br>Can you hear me,<br>major Tom?<br>Can you...</p>
	<p>Here am I floating 'round my tin can<br>Far above the moon<br>Planet Earth is blue<br>And theres nothing I can do...</p>
