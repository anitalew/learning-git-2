	<h1>Space oddity</h1>
	<h3>Author: David Bowie</h3>
	<p>Ground control to major Tom<br>Ground control to major Tom<br>Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.</p>
	<p>Ground control to major Tom<br>Commencing countdown, engines on<br>Check ignition and may Gods love be with you...</p>
	<p>(Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,<br>Four, three, two, one, liftoff...)</p>
	<p>This is ground control to major Tom<br>You've really made the grade!<br>And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear.<br>Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare</p>
	<p>This is major Tom to ground control;<br>I'm stepping through the door<br>And I'm floating in a most peculiar way<br>And the stars look very different today.</p>
